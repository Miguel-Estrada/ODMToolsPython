The Simple Filter is used to restrict the list of series for display and selection by common filters: Site and Variable (or both). When the Simple Filter radio button is selected, an expander button is automatically pressed, and the 'Site' and 'Variable' filters are visible. The exapander button can be used to show/hide the filter criteria.

To use either or both of the filters, click the checkbox next to 'Site' or 'Variable'. When the checkbox on the filter is selected, the list of Sites or Variables is available for selection. Selecting a site and/or variable restricts the list of series available for selection to those corresponding to the filters.

Note that it is possible to check a series for plotting and then apply the filter to exclude that series from the Series Selector. The series will remain plotted. If it is desired to remove that series from the plot, it is necessary to take steps to show that series in the Series Selector again.

Note that the Advanced Filter functionality is not yet implemented. It will permit the filtering of data series based on a user-defined SQL query.
